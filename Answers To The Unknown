Prior to Independence Day 22' my goal is to successfully challenge the Microsoft PL 900 certification.
To have received a raise after one year of successfully working as a Data Analyst. 
I'm unsure of which pathway I will choose but I will try the Data Engineer route. 

List first idea of goals for capstone
