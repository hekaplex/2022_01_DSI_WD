1. Achieve complete self-sufficiency as a digital nomad. :computer: :airplane: :earth_asia:

2. Launch multi-chain DeFi application :tm:

3. Data Science  :shipit:

4. At this moment, I am committed to implementing Computer Vision into the capstone via the OpenCV library. It is my hope to one day soon work remotely for a company such as Tesla (Autopilot) or Comma.ai (OpenPilot). If I should fail, I will concurrently build a lean backup project based upon Predictive Analytics.

```
Obstacle Analysis: In learning to implement OpenCV lane detection for this capstone, I am currently at odds with the cv2.waitkey(wait time in milliseconds) function within the OpenCV library. I believe the dilemma may however be remedied via passing '0' into the argument --> ()... Allowing the frames to be displayed for an infinite amount of time. The next step therein is to implement a loop through the frame.
