1. Achieve complete self-sufficiency as a digital nomad. :computer: :airplane: :earth_asia:

2. Begin receiving royalties for NFT collection & Launch multi-chain DeFi application :tm:

3. ~~Data Science~~  :brain: Artificial Intelligence

4. At this moment, I am committed to implementing Computer Vision into the capstone via the OpenCV library. It is my hope to one day soon work remotely for a company such as Tesla (Autopilot) or Comma.ai (OpenPilot). AUSTIN OR BUST!! :airplane:


## *Obstacle Analysis:* Currently implementing Hough Line Transform. 

```
According to the Hough transform algorithm the image needs to be converted to ‘GRAY’ colorspace...
and sent for edge detection for which we use Canny function. 
Since the hough function returns an array of multiple subarrays, in order to loop through them I will initiate a for a loop

image: Image src rho: Distance resolution of the accumulator (distance from the coordinate origin in the hough space)
theta: Angle resolution of the accumulator(Line rotation in radians)
threshold: Accumulator threshold parameter(Lines are only selected if they get votes equal to the threshold value))
minLineLength: Line segments shorter than this value are rejected
maxLineGap: Max allowd gap between line segments to treat them as a single line
```
