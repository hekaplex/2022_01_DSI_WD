## *Obstacle Analysis:* Currently implementing Hough Line Transform. 

```
According to the Hough transform algorithm the image needs to be converted to ‚ÄòGRAY‚Äô colorspace...
and sent for edge detection for which we use Canny function. 
Since the hough function returns an array of multiple subarrays, in order to loop through them I will initiate a for a loop

image: Image src rho: Distance resolution of the accumulator (distance from the coordinate origin in the hough space)
theta: Angle resolution of the accumulator(Line rotation in radians)
threshold: Accumulator threshold parameter(Lines are only selected if they get votes equal to the threshold value))
minLineLength: Line segments shorter than this value are rejected
maxLineGap: Max allowd gap between line segments to treat them as a single line

# *HAIL MARY* 

```
Upon researching the current state of computer vision within the domain of lane detection... 
I discovered a host of Tesla owners who have noticed a frightening dilemma called "phantom braking". 
While the issue is currently under investigation, I would wager that this issue is caused from shadows cast over the roadway. 
Thus, the code underpinning the Tesla Autopilot is detecting obstacles which aren't there... 
as the video feed is converted to 'GRAY' colorspace which renders each frame black. 
Meaning that any shadow cast within the feed potentially obscures the lane space as ordained by the Autopilot system. Quite a critical
vulnerability and suggests autonomous driving is still in it's infancy... and thusly, my interest has been lessened. 
That said, I have taken it upon myself to build a secondary capstone... 
to showcase my true capabilities and defeat the gatekeepers: Project ONUS
