# About

MartianHacks is a jupyter notebook  which contains the main commands executed during a penetration test.

The jupyter notebooks allow you to execute commands individually and collect the relative output in a very organized manner.
The python notebooks also make the transition from the commands execution to final report much easier.

It's possible to execute the notebook in a local server and, consequently, attack the machines on the LAN or execute it in a remote server and attack public IP.
In this last scenario, it's convenient to exploit Google Colab service to use the powerfull hardware offered by Google (Tesla K80); in particulary, this is desirable for the password cracking phase.

# Tools
This jupyter notebook will install the following tools:

- Nmap
- Dirb
- Nikto
- Searchsploit
- hashcat
- xmllint

Also, several wordlists will be downloaded:

- URLs for http enumeration
- common web file extensions
- fasttrack.txt
- rockyou.txt

# Screenshots

Collect nmap output directly under the command execution instead of copying the result into a text editor.
